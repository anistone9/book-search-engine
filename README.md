## Description     
Need to update: This project consisted in building the back end for a social network web application. The application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Models are included for Users and Thoughts, and a Schema for Reactions. Users can use this application to share their thoughts, create a friends list, and react to thoughts added by their friends.

## Installation   
Need to update: Clone the repository in GitHub, and install Node.js and MongoDB. You will need to use Express.js and Mongoose packages.               

# Usage    
Need to update: To use this application, open the integrated terminal and run npm init, then npm i (install). You might be required to also run 'npm install mongoose' as well. Seeding the database is optional, but will allow testing certain routes without needing to create users and thoughts from scratch. Finally, run 'node index' and open Insomnia to run the API routes.
